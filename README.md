## Overview

JalRakshak AI ingests real-time sensor readings from water sources (pH, TDS, Conductivity, Turbidity), runs them through a trained Machine Learning model, and returns:

- A **safe/unsafe classification** of the water
- A **safety score** (0–100)
- A **risk level** (Low / Moderate / High)
- **Possible contamination causes**
- **Recommended remediation actions**
- A **future risk trend** based on rolling sensor history

---

## How the Model Works

### 1. Dataset
The model is trained on the [Water Potability dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability), which contains physicochemical water quality measurements. Four sensor-friendly features are extracted:

| Feature | Original Column | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ph` | `ph` | Acidity/alkalinity of water (ideal: 6.5–8.5) |
| `tds` | `Solids` | Total Dissolved Solids in mg/L (safe: < 500) |
| `conductivity` | `Conductivity` | Electrical conductivity in μS/cm (safe: < 600) |
| `turbidity` | `Turbidity` | Water clarity in NTU (safe: < 5) |

Target label: `Potability` (1 = potable/safe, 0 = not potable/unsafe)

### 2. Preprocessing (`utils/preprocess.py`)
- Selects the four sensor features and the `Potability` label
- Renames columns to lowercase, consistent names
- Fills missing values with the **column mean** (mean imputation)

### 3. Model Training (`models/train_model.py`)
- Algorithm: **Random Forest Classifier** (`n_estimators=200`)
- Split: 80% training / 20% testing (`random_state=42`)
- Saved as `models/water_model.pkl` using `joblib`

Random Forest was chosen because:
- It handles non-linear relationships between water quality parameters
- Robust to outliers (common in sensor data)
- Natively provides **class probability estimates** for confidence scoring

### 4. Prediction Pipeline (`api/main.py`)
When a `/predict` request is received, the following steps run:

```
Sensor Input (ph, tds, conductivity, turbidity)
        │
        ▼
   ML Model Prediction ──► potable / not potable + confidence %
        │
        ▼
   Safety Score Calculator (rule-based, 0–100)
        │
        ▼
   Cause Detector (identifies which parameters are out of range)
        │
        ▼
   Recommendation Engine (suggests remediation actions)
        │
        ▼
   Risk Level Classifier (Low / Moderate / High)
        │
        ▼
   Future Risk Analyzer (trend detection over last 5 readings)
        │
        ▼
   JSON Response
```

### 5. Safety Score Logic
The score starts at 100 and deductions are applied based on threshold breaches:

| Parameter | Condition | Penalty |
|---|---|---|
| Turbidity | > 5 NTU | −30 |
| TDS | > 500 mg/L | −25 |
| pH | < 6.5 or > 8.5 | −20 |
| Conductivity | > 600 μS/cm | −15 |

Score is clamped to a minimum of 0. The final water status uses **both** the ML prediction and the safety score — if either indicates unsafe, the water is flagged as **Unsafe**.

### 6. Future Risk Analysis
A rolling window of the **last 5 sensor readings** is kept in memory. Trend rules:
- If turbidity increased by more than 2 NTU → contamination risk increasing
- If TDS increased by more than 100 mg/L → possible chemical contamination developing
- Otherwise → parameters stable

## Running the Project

**Start the API server:**
```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

**Run the sensor simulator** (in a separate terminal, while the API is running):
```bash
python sensor_simulator.py
```
The simulator sends random sensor readings to the API every 5 seconds and prints the JSON response.

**Interactive API docs:**  
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the auto-generated Swagger UI.
